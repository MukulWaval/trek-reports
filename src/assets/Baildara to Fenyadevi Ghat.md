Baildara Trail (to Kalakrai)

Follow the Baildara trail, which is narrow and overgrown with karvi.

Descend from 700m to 450m to reach a four-way junction.

Turn left (westward) to continue towards Kalakrai village.

Straight down leads to a small village in Raigad district (do not take this path).

Turn right to visit an old well

The trail widens as you proceed westward.

Upon reaching Kalakrai, this marks the halfway point—take a short break here.

Kalakrai to Vitthalvadi via Fenyadevi Ghat

From Kalakrai, head westward along the Fenyadevi ghat trail.

The trail eventually makes a sharp southward turn. Look for a stone relic under a tree at this point.

Continue to the Fenyadevi ghat, which is wide and rocky.

## **Activities and Learning**

### Navigation Challenges:

The team faced a significant challenge during the descent from Baildara, where a missed junction delayed progress.
