## Route Description

The trek began in Vitthalvadi Village, where we were greeted by the sight of Kothaligad Fort in the distance. The trail initially led us up a hillock offering panoramic views of Peth village. Moving westward, we entered the Baildara Trail, characterized by dense karvi shrubs and unmarked paths. The trail descended sharply to Kalakrai Village, where we paused for a short break.

From Kalakrai, the route transitioned to the Fenyadevi Ghat Trail, featuring steep ascents, dramatic rock formations, and ancient stone relics. The final stretch involved navigating narrow footpaths back to Vitthalvadi Village, concluding the trek.
